*READ BEFORE OPENING AN ISSUE*

react-twitter-widgets is a thin wrapper around the official Twitter for Websites factory functions.

This is remote code that can and has changed on a whim. Bugs are often introduced.

Do not open issues here for bugs or questions related to the actual widget. For that, you can use https://twittercommunity.com/.

Open an issue *if it occurs only with react-twitter-widgets and not the vanilla factory functions* (use Codepen or similar to test).

Delete this entire message before writing your issue.

Thank you.
